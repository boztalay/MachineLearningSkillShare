To run this, you'll need [the NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/install.html)

First, run `python trainingSetGenerator.py`, which will create `examples.py` that holds two lists of examples for the naive Bayes classifier. One is for training, and one is for testing/classification.

Then, you can train the classifier and test its performance by running `python naiveBayesExample.py`
